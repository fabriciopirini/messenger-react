# Cognite interview workspace

This boilerplate is provided for candidates before interviews so we can spend as much time as possible doing interesting stuff in the interview.

If you prefer to set up something on your own, feel free to do so.
We don't require you to use React, but make sure that your enviroment is set up and ready to go.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Preparing for the interview

Set this up on your local machine and make sure that you can run the application.  
Running `npm start` should show you a working application on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
This should reload automatically with any changes you make.

Running `npm test` should run tests from all files of the form `*.test.js`

Feel free to add any tooling you want, and make sure that your editor is set up for you to work efficiently.
